Ok so turbo repo is basically a repo which caches builds so that we dont build the same thing again and again
it also has a dependency graph thing so to build something lets say that it has dependency to something else
so we basically build that first and assume two things are depended on it now that the dependency is build
we can basically build those two things parallelly.

Okay now so the packages is the folder that is common (it might contain like react components dependencies etc) to the next.js applications (yes there is more than one)
so we update those packages which are common to them look at packages/ui/src those are the components
used by both the apps/docs and apps/web
